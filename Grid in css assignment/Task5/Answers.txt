
justify-items and justify-self are two CSS properties that can be used to align grid items within their grid cells. justify-items applies to all grid items in a grid container, while justify-self applies to individual grid items.

justify-items can be used to set the default alignment for all grid items in a container. For example, if you set justify-items to right, all grid items in the container will be aligned to the right of their grid cells.

justify-self can be used to override the default alignment for individual grid items. For example, if you set justify-self to left on a grid item, that grid item will be aligned to the left of its grid cell, even if the default alignment for the container is right.

This can be useful for creating more complex and flexible grid layouts. For example, you could use justify-items to center all grid items in a container, and then use justify-self to left-align or right-align individual grid items as needed.

Here is a simple example of how to use justify-items and justify-self:

<div class="container">
  <div class="grid-item-1">Grid item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item-2">Grid item 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item-3">Grid item 3</div>
</div>

CSS
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  justify-items: center;
}

.grid-item-2 {
  justify-self: right;
}


This will create a three-column grid with all grid items centered by default. However, the second grid item will be right-aligned, overriding the default alignment for the container.
